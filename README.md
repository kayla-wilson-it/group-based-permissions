# Group-Based Permissions & Least Privilege

## Overview
This project demonstrates hands-on experience implementing group-based permissions and enforcing least-privilege access in a Windows Server Active Directory environment. The goal was to restrict folder access to only authorized users.

## Environment
- Oracle VirtualBox  
- Windows Server  
- Active Directory Domain Services  

## Objectives
- Create security groups in Active Directory  
- Assign users to groups based on role  
- Configure folder permissions to enforce least-privilege access  
- Test access for authorized and unauthorized users  
- Document configuration with screenshots  

## Security Controls Implemented
- HR-Team security group created  
- Users assigned to the appropriate group  
- NTFS permissions applied to restrict folder access  
- Unauthorized users denied access  

## Why This Matters
Least-privilege access ensures sensitive information is only accessible to those who need it, reducing the risk of data breaches and maintaining compliance with security policies.

## Evidence
Screenshots included demonstrate:
1. Security group creation  
2. Group members  
3. Folder permissions  
4. Unauthorized access attempts
